## Hardware hacking
Any activity that manipulates electronic devices in unintended ways with the purpose of gaining access to data or changing its behaviour.

## Hardware hacking
- There is a large number of techniques, methods and activities that will fit under this definition. 
	- Some are quite common and accessible
	- Some requires very specialized equipment and expertice
	- More will probably be added in the future
- This is not a complete list, but most of the more popular techniques are mentioned

---
## Reading memory devices
- Through existing interfaces
- In circuit
- Chip-off
- On die

## Fuzzing interfaces
- Low level
	- UART
	- JTAG
	- Debug
- High(er) level
	- USB
	- Network
