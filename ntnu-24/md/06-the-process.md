# Building an attack

--
## What do we want?

--
- All the data?
- Some specific data?
- Passswords, hashes, credentials?
- Firmware / ROM content
- Fuse content
- Encryption materials

-- 
## Our constraints

--
- Can we get test samples?
- Any tamper protection?
- Do we have the appropriate equipment?
- Any time restrictions?
- What are we allowed to do?

--
## Risk assessment

--
- How can it be damaged
- How do we avoid tamper protection
- Identify high risk operations
    - What are the consequences of failure
- Identify the lowest risk operation that have a good chance at success


--
## The plan

--
- What do we try?
- And in what order?
    - Managing risk
    - Mindful of anything that can't be reversed
- Decide on the success criteria

--
## Implementing the attack

--
- The planning can only get you that far
- This is a journey into the unknown
- Always be ready to revisit the plan
- Stop and think if you are uncertain

--
### If we have many test devices
- Driven by experiment
- We can take higher risk
- Use an iterative process

--
### Few or no devices
- More driven by hyptheses
- Need to pay careful attention to the risk assessment
- A belt and suspenders approach
