## Equipment
We have identified two main approaches

- Turn-key solution (Riscure)
- Cobbled together (Everything else)

--
## Turn-key solution (Riscure)
- Specificly made for side-channel / fault injection
- Very locked-in eco system
- difficult to combine with other equipment
- Subscription based licensing
- Very expensive
- Support is available

--
## Cobbled together
- Generic lab instruments
- Repurposed hardware
- Custom made hardware
- Self made hardware
- Self made controlling software

--
## What do we prefer?
We decided to pass on the Riscure eco system due to the lack of flexibility, and the exptremely high cost.

We get much more control using our own equipment, at a lower cost.

## Skill and knowledge
Finding real experts in their given field is the most important factor.
